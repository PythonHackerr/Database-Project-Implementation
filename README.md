# Database Project

The goal of the project is to practice designing a relational database structure for a simple OLTP problem, using ER (Entity-Relationship) modeling.

## Task: 

A distributor from the automotive industry creates a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. You need to store basic customer data (name and surname, address) and a marketing profile - the survey result. The survey contains several questions about the client's family and financial situation and lifestyle. There are several possible answers to each of these questions; the customer can choose more than one of them.
